This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create 16Ã—16 pixel-style images.
Through adversarial training, the generator improves the realism of generated images while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake.

Environment Setup  
Python 3.9+  
PyTorch 2.0+  
torchvision  
matplotlib  
numpy  

Key Features  
Checkpoint auto save and breakpoint continuation training  
Visualize generated images and observe training effects in real-time

Future Improvements  
Introduce more training techniques such as gradient penalty, label smoothing, etc  
Adjust hyperparameters to generate high quality image
